## About

EduMotion helps teachers log students emotional data after each classroom activity in order to track emotional success within the classroom.  EduMotion will provide teachers and the parents ability to reduce the hypothesis space and form higher granularity into student observations.  Most educational programs are currently set up with focus around test scores and academic achievement, but for students that suffer from disabilities like asperger's or attention deficit disorder, looking at achievement through standard methods might not be the best option to see real progress.  


## Installation
Download to your project directory with the following commands:
```git clone directory git@github.com:helanan/EduMotion.git
   cd into the main directory
   run the server out of port 8080
