## About

EduMotion helps teachers log students emotional data after each classroom activity in order to track emotional success within the classroom.  EduMotion will provide teachers and the parents ability to reduce the hypothesis space and form higher granularity into student observations.  Most educational programs are currently set up with focus around test scores and academic achievement, but for students that suffer from disabilities like asperger's or attention deficit disorder, looking at achievement through standard methods might not be the best option to see real progress.  

- Authentication is handled through a Register, Login or Google pop-up provider, in order for the user to access the application
- Once a user is logged in a navbar is displayed for the user to select where they would like to navigate to within the application, a user can add a new student, log an emotion, practice mindful breathing exercises or check out chart analytics
- Once a user has filled out the new student form displayed after login, the user is redirected to the student list page that shows all student details and provides users an option to either edit, delete or add an emotion for student, as well as gives the user the ability to interact with the emotion chart.
- After the user has completed viewing their students, the user will add an emotion within the emotion form, and has the option to log one or multiple emotions within a single session. The user will fill complete the emotion information form and the emotion will be posted to the emotion list page.
- A user will redirect to the Emotion List page once an emotion(s) is completed and has the ability to edit, delete, and view a students emotion.  
- When a user is finished with the application, the user will have the option to logout within the navbar options and will be redirected to the authentication page.
